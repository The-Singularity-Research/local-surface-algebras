Study finite dimensional quotients of cyclic quivers
---
Taking quotients by paths of some maximal length $n$ of the cyclic quivers as described in [The Composition Algebra of a Cyclic Quiver](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/loac-surface-algebras/blob/main/15988304.pdf) we get finite dimensional algebras. A gluing
of a collection of such algebras according to the methods described in [Surface Algebras I](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes/blob/master/Surface_Algebras_I%20(3).pdf) we obtain a finite dimensional surface algebra. Finite dimensional surface algebras and their representation theory can be studied using GAP and in particular the package [QPA](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/qpa/doc/chap0.html#contents) for quiver path algebras.
