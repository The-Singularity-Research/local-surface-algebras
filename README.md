Study finite dimensional quotients of cyclic quivers
---
Taking quotients by paths of some maximal length $n$ of the cyclic quivers as described in [The Composition Algebra of a Cyclic Quiver](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/loac-surface-algebras/blob/main/15988304.pdf) we get finite dimensional algebras. A gluing
of a collection of such algebras according to the methods described in [Surface Algebras I](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes/blob/master/Surface_Algebras_I%20(3).pdf) we obtain a finite dimensional surface algebra. Finite dimensional surface algebras and their representation theory can be studied using GAP and in particular the package [QPA](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/qpa/doc/chap0.html#contents) for quiver path algebras. We will call the cyclic quivers in the gluing *"local surface algebras"* and the algebras obtained from their gluings **"Finite Dimensional Surface Algebras"**. The Finite Dimensional Surface Algebras will have gentle relations corresponding to crossing over from one local cyclic quiver path algebra to another, along with the additional relations given by the quotient by paths of some maximal length on each cycle. The maximal length paths will in general be different for each local cyclic path algebra. Moreover, we can think of this as a generalization of G. t'Hooft's cyclic harmonic oscillators in his [Cellular Automata Approach to Quantum Mechanics](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/local-surface-algebras/blob/main/1405.1548.pdf) (see p. 23 of the arXiv version).

Our generalization allows for high energy levels by allowing for returning to a vertex of the quiver (corresponding to a simple module of the path algebra in the Ringel paper) so that the system is a periodic covering of t'Hooft's "cogwheel model".
